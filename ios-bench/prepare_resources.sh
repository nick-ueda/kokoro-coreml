# Populate ios-bench/Resources from repo-local artifacts.
#
# Resources/coreml and Resources/mlx are gitignored (hundreds of MB of model
# artifacts); this script makes the checkout buildable. Run it before
# `xcodegen generate` — xcodegen globs Resources/* at generate time, so new
# packages need a re-generate to enter the Xcode resources phase.
#
# Sources:
#   - Core ML packages: ../coreml/ (produced by export_duration.py,
#     export_f0ntrain.py, export_decoder_pre.py, export_synth/ — see
#     README/Wiki/coreml-export.md)
#   - Bench inputs: produced by scripts/prepare_swift_bench_inputs.py
#     (committed — small JSON)
#   - MLX weights (optional, only for the mlx arm): kokoro-v1_0.safetensors
#     and voices.npz from the mlalma/KokoroTestApp distribution; place them
#     in Resources/mlx manually if benchmarking the MLX arm.
